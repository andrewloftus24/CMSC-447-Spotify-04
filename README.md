# CMSC-447-Spotify-04 - Andrew's Development Branch

## Changelog - 10/26/21

* Very basic shell used for incorporating BootStrap into Django
* Contains a NavBar that allows you to jump between the 'Home' page and the 'About' page
* NavBar will automatically resize when the browser width reaches a certain value (done automatically by BootStrap)
* NavBar is global, so any updates to it will be reflected across all pages that include it

## Dependencies

* Python 3.8
* Django

## How To Run

* Clone the repository to a local project in your IDE (PyCharm preferred)
* Open up the terminal, run the command "python manage.py runserver"
* Once the server is running, click the link in the terminal or visit "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
* To close the server, press "CTRL+C" in the terminal

## Future Additions

* Implement multiple pages based on group discussions as to what we want our product to have
* Incorporate Spotify API elements into the frontend
* Functional dropdown menu when browser resize occurs
